## Key Features

- Customize the importance of title and description fields using configurable weights.

### Containment Boost
- Boosts the score if the query is found as a substring in the title or description, ensuring more relevant results are prioritized.

### Threshold Filtering
- Filters out results with scores below a specified threshold to improve result quality.

### Pagination
- Supports paginated results for better usability with large datasets.
